\begin{posterbox}[name=overview,column=0,row=0]{Overview}
\begin{itemize}
  \item Text in images and video frames is one of the most powerful sources of high-level semantics once the text can be detected, localized and recognized automatically.
  \item In this paper, we develop a two-stage method to detect and locate text lines from complex background.
  \item The experiment on challenging datasets from ICDAR shows that this is a fast and robust method to detect and locate text lines in complex background.
\end{itemize}
\end{posterbox}









\begin{posterbox}[name=method,column=0,below=overview]{Our Method}
\begin{itemize}
  \item A coarse-to-fine two-stage architecture
  \item At the coarse stage, our method use several basic features of text to select candidate text lines.
  \item At the fine stage, using candidates from the first stage as input, an SVM classifier based on HOG feature and co-occurrence matrix features identify true text lines from candidates.
\end{itemize}
\end{posterbox}










\begin{posterbox}[name=text,column=0,below=method]{Properties of Text}

\begin{itemize}
  \item Edge:
    \begin{itemize}
      \item Most texts are designed to be striking and easily read.
      \item Thereby resulting in strong edges at the boundaries of text and background.
    \end{itemize}
  \item Color:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Every single character tends to have the same or similar color.
    \end{itemize}
  \item Edge:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Texts appear in clusters.
        \item Characters within a text line tend to have similar size and are always aligned.
    \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\end{posterbox}











\begin{posterbox}[name=pipeline,column=0,below=text,above=bottom]{Pipeline of Coarse Detection}
The goal of coarse detection is to find text-like textures from original image.\\
We developed a method to find text-like textures as follow:\\
%\begin{equation}
%  f_X(x|\mu,\sigma^2) = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2\pi\sigma^2}}\exp\left\{\frac{1}{2\sigma^2}(x-\mu)^2\right\}
%\end{equation}

\begin{itemize}

    \label{fig:figlabel}

  \item Co-occurrence Matrix features:
  \begin{itemize}
    \item Statistics:
    \begin{equation}
        Contrast: \sum_{i,j} |i-j|^2 p(i,j)
    \end{equation}
    \begin{equation}
        Correlation: \sum_{i,j} \frac{(i-\mu_i)(j-\mu_j)p(i,j)}{\sigma_i\sigma_j}
    \end{equation}
    \begin{equation}
        Energy: \sum_{i,j} p(i,j)^2
    \end{equation}
    \begin{equation}
        Homogeneity: \sum_{i,j} \frac{p(i,j)}{1+|i-j|}
    \end{equation}

    \item Different offsets are used:

    \item Unsupervised Feature Learning also known as Deep Learning gives a promising way to find intrinsic feature of text pattern.
    \item Try to use a more efficient detection strategy like classifier cascade.
